# bingo-functional-repl

A simple REPL for the [bingo-functional](https://github.com/ace411/bingo-functional) library.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.1 or greater

- [apcu extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.apcu.php)

## Rationale

The bingo-functional-repl is simply a playground for bingo-functional utilities - mostly helper functions. It is capable of selectively parsing PHP syntax and conveying results.

The REPL is a 100% opt-in tool for testing bingo-functional's offerings in a console before using them in more elaborate projects.

## Installation

Though it is possible to clone the repo, Composer remains the best tool for installing bingo-functional-repl. To install the package via Composer, type the following in a console of your choosing:

```sh
composer require chemem/bingo-functional-repl
```

## Usage

Upon successful installation of the package, type the following - also in a preferred CLI - to activate the REPL.

```sh
vendor/bin/bfrepl
```

## Documentation

Please check out the [documentation](https://ace411.github.io/bingo-functional/#/repl) for more knowledge on how to use this library.
