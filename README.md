A simple REPL for the bingo-functional library.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or greater

- ext-apcu

## Rationale

The bingo-functional REPL is designed to be a playground for [bingo-functional](https://github.com/ace411/bingo-functional) artifacts - functions, monads, applicatives, and immutable structures.

The REPL can be considered a 100% opt-in tool for testing bingo-functional's potencies - one that informs approaches to library usage in more elaborate contexts.

## Installation

Though it is possible to clone the repo, Composer remains the best tool for installing bingo-functional-repl. To install the package via Composer, type the following in a console of your choosing.

```sh
composer require chemem/bingo-functional-repl
```

## Usage

Upon successful installation of the package, type the following - also in a preferred CLI - to activate the shell.

```sh
path/to/vendor/bin/bfrepl
```
